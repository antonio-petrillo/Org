* Algorithm
#+begin_src c
int is_exact_power_of_2(int n) {
  return !(n & (n - 1));
}
#+end_src

* Note
In binary an exact power of $2$ has all the bits set to $0$ but one, hence if a number don't share any digit with it's predecessor it is a power of 2.

* Time complexity
An extremely easy and intuitive $O(1)$.
