* First Normal Form (1NF)
+ Each table has a unique primary key
+ A row cannot have a nested table as its value

* Second Normal Form (2NF)
+ Inherit *1NF*
+ All columns that are not part of the /primary key/ are dependant on the _entire_ primary key

** Note
+ 2NF may cause performance issue
+ Rule of thumb:
  1. Implement 2NF
  2. De-normalize only for performance reason

* Third Normal Form (3NF)
+ Inherit *2NF*
+ All columns that aren't part of the /primary key/ are dependant _only_ on the primary key.

** Note
+ Same as 2NF

* Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF or 3.5NF)
+ Inherit *3NF*
+ A column that's part of a primary key can not be entirely dependent on a column that's not part of that primary key

** Note
+ Same as 3NF
+ Can happen when there are multiple candidate keys and some column are overlapping (overlapping primary keys)
